# JSL05 Project: Task Board with Local Storage Persistence and Task Creation

## Overview

In this project, I have implement a task management system where **tasks are persisted in local storage**, ensuring that tasks remain available even after refreshing the page or reopening the application. Users will be able to **add new tasks**, with the task details being **stored in local storage** and displayed in the appropriate **columns** ("To Do", "Doing", "Done"). The application also includes an **Add Task** modal for creating new tasks.

## Project setup

I started this project by copying over my previous project's data. I then removed any unneeded data. After that, I edited and set up the modal to be able to change a task or add a new task. Then, I changed the modal's appearance with HTML and CSS. I then used JavaScript to give my open-modal-btn and task containers the functionality to open their modals and display their data when clicked on. Finally, I added functions to my JavaScript to save, change, or add tasks to my Local Storage and then be able to load their contents when starting up the website.

## Outcome
